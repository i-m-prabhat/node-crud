Working with Multer :-
***********************
multer is a middleware package used to perform file uploading in server

concept behind file uploading:-
*********************************

xyz file local system : different machine
                        |
                        |
                       copy
                        |
                        |
Another Machine : server on port : 8080
public
    |uploads
        |1.png 2.png aforApple,jpg............etc.

        Problem :- we cannot upload, large amount of data in mongodb atlas because of size restriction.
        Atlas free version = 1gb of free space.
        if you buy, Enterprice solution or aws server.
        they give you memory in Terabyte.

        in That case you can only store the data in local temporay space and save the filename as text in mongodb.


Using multer you can upload single/multiple files.

to upload single file : we use upload.single('input-file-name');
to upload multiple file : we use upload.multiple('input-file-name')folder.


steps to file uploads:-
1. public
    |uploads

2. npm install multer
3. create multer instance
    const upload = multer({
        dest:"public/uploads"
    });
    Eg :-
    <input type="file" name="image" />
4. Router.post('/add-img',upload.single('image'),(req,res)=>{
    console.log(req.file);
})

Problem : file which will be upload is not of readable format
since this file does not have any extension. that is why,
this file won't be readable.

if you goto file, and rename the file with extension you want.
you can read the file.
